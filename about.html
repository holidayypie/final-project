        <p>The most important thing to me for me to stay in my good energy is to be outside!
            I think we can find peace and healing just by getting some fresh air and some sun. 
            One of my favorite outdoor activities is to go rafting. I love anything that has to 
            do with being out in the water. Its also a great activity to enjoy as a family.</p>
